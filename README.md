Custom-Npcs-Scripts
===================

Custom-Npcs-Scripts is a collection of Javascript scripts for the Minecraft-Mod <a href="http://www.kodevelopment.nl/minecraft/customnpcs">Custom Npcs</a>.
I created this project after watching Etho's Modded Minecraft Series. I really liked the ideas he spoke about and thought it would be an interesting challange.
I am not affilated with Etho in any way. I am developing on this in my free time.

How to use:
===========
If you want to use my Scripts just download this repository as zip(see on the right) and put the scripts in the scripts folder of Custom Npcs. You can find the
scripts folder in your world save or just use the button in the scripting interface of any NPC in your world.

I am probably going to go more indepth in the future.
